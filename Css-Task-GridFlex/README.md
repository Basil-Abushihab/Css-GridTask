# Task description:
- This task is compromised of three tasks-

firstly: The Grid task where we have to apply our understanding of the grid in order to come up with a layout which includes multiple elements.

secondly: a flex task for this task we needed to make a simple list view of users with their majors this was done using flex display property while setting the direction to be column and adding multiple divs to the flex container containing the user image name and major with some design

thirdly: a mix of both grid and flex where the objective was to setup a grid view which contains a div which in turn contains multiple images displayed in a flex box with horizontal direction and space around property.
